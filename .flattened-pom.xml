  <description>R can use `rJava` to communicate with java. R also has a class system called R6. If you want to use a java library 
	  with native `rJava` in R there is potentially a lot of glue code needed, and R library specific packaging configuration required.
	  However if you don't mind writing an R-centric API in Java you can generate all of this glue code using a few Java annotations 
	  and normal javadoc comments. This maven plugin provides an annotation processor that writes that glue code and creates a fairly 
	  transparent connection between Java code and R code, with a minimum of hard work. The focus of this is streamlining the creation of R 
	  packages that wrap Java libraries by Java developers, rather than allowing access to arbitrary Java code from R. The ultimate aim of 
	  this plugin to allow java developers to provide simple APIs for their libraries, package their library using Maven, push it to github and for that to 
	  become seamlessly available as an R package, with a minimal amount of fuss. A focus is on trying to produce CI ready libraries 
	  tested with Github workflows and ready for `r-universe` submission.</description>
